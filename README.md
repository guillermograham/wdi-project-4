#Â WDI Project 4

A flashcard-generating application, used for vocabulary acquisition. This application was inspired by my love of language learning and allows users to create and share flashcards, and also test themselves. The logic ensures repetition of the flashcards which the user finds more difficult to remember.

### Technologies used

During the creation of this project, I used the following technologies:

* Animate CSS
* Axios
* Babel
* bcrypt
* Bluebird
* Body-parser
* Chai
* Enzyme
* Express
* Font Awesome
* Git
* GitHub
* Heroku
* HTML 5
* JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
* JSON Web Token
* Lodash
* Mocha
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Morgan
* Node.js
* NYC
* React
* SCSS
* Sinon
* Supertest
* Webpack

### Wins

* The application is fully mobile responsive. As wordUp is designed for regular and quick vocabulary testing, it is vital that it functions on mobile devices. This was achieved through a mobile-first design approach, using Balsamiq wireframes during the planning stage.

* A clean, fresh design was achieved on this project. This is particularly down to the integration of Animate CSS for the pop up messages during form validation and also during flash-card utilisation - giving the app a slick, professional feel. Bulma.io was used for its lightweight feel and customised using a colour palette from the Coolors website, providing an individual edge. FontAwesome icons also enhance the appearance of the app.

### Challenges faced

* This was my first large-scale project built using React. As such, it proved difficult to plan the project. This challenge was overcome by using Trello during the planning stage to ensure that each process was thought through prior to the build stage.

### Where next?

* I would like to incorporate a translation API into the flashcard-creation process of the app. This would allow users to create flashcards by typing in the word in English, then the API would translate this for them into the target language.
